## about
`NetworkX` analyses the political affiliation of social network clusters on a subset of Twitter users from a specific geolocation _(default: Tampa, Florida, 150km radius)_. 

Features:
* investigate the change in political engagement
* identify changes in political affiliation clusters
* store the data in neo4j-database
* frontend to investigate findings [`visual`](./visual)

### motivation
Our idea came up in a conversation when we were wondering how we can identify an individualâ€™s political preferences in social media. It seems quite obvious that we interact with content and people of similar views, but it's also the case that the environment we're in exerts pressure on ourselves. Hence our motivation to build a model and investigate what happens in the real world.
